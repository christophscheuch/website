I recently joined [wikifolio](https://www.wikifolio.com) as Head of Business Intelligence and Data Science. 

Before joining wikifolio, I graduated from the [Vienna Graduate School of Finance](https://www.vgsf.ac.at/) where my research focused on the economics of technological innovations in the financial sector. One of my papers shows how blockchain-based settlement introduces limits to arbitrage in cross-market trading. In another paper, I analyze how consumers react to the introduction of overdraft facilities through a mobile banking app. In my solo-authored paper, I investigate the potential of crowdfunding mechanisms to elicit demand information and improve the screening of viable projects under different valuation structures.
