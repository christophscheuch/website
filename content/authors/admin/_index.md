I am a PhD student at the Vienna Graduate School of Finance. My research interests focus on the economics of technological innovations in the financial industry. I recently released a paper which shows that blockchain-based settlement may introduce limits to arbitrage in cross-market trading. In another paper, I analyze how consumers react to the availability of overdraft facilities through mobile banking apps. I currently investigate the potential of crowdfunding mechanisms to elicit demand information and improve the screening of viable projects. 

Before starting my PhD studies, I was a research assistant in the field of labor economics at the Institute for Advanced Studies and an intern at Ithuba Capital and the Austrian Financial Market Authority.
