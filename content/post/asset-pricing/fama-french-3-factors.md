<p>This note is an effort to replicate the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fama%E2%80%93French_three-factor_model">Fama-French three-factor model</a>, in particular the three factors that enter its equation: the market factor, the size factor (small firms outperform larger firms), and the value factor (firms with high book-to-market equity ratios outperform firms with low ratios). Throughout this note, I build on earlier posts that explored empirical asset pricing approaches in a similar direction. Namely, <a href="https://christophscheuch.github.io/post/asset-pricing/crsp-sample/">I constructed the CRSP stock return sample</a>, <a href="https://christophscheuch.github.io/post/asset-pricing/beta/">I estimated stock-specific market betas</a>, and <a href="https://christophscheuch.github.io/post/asset-pricing/size/">I analyzed the relation between stock returns and size</a> and <a href="https://christophscheuch.github.io/post/asset-pricing/value/">I replicated the value premium</a>. I keep the description of individual steps very short and refer to these notes for more details.</p>
<p>At the end of this post, I demontrate that my effort yields a decent result: my version of the <code>mkt</code> factor exhibits a 99% correlation with the market factor provided on Kenneth French’s website. Similarly, my <code>smb</code> and <code>hml</code> factors show a 98% and 95% correlation, respectively, with the original data. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/waynelinchang/home">Wayne Chang</a> provides an R script on his website that supposedly achieves higher correlations. However, I have to admit that I have not yet tried to run his code because I find it very hard to grasp what is going on by just glancing over it. Maybe I’ll devote some more time to his code at a later stage.</p>

<h2>Prepare CRSP Data</h2>
<p>This note is self-contained in the sense that everything starts from the raw data. First, I need to construct the sample of monthly stock returns. The code chunk below exhibits two differences to the <a href="https://christophscheuch.github.io/post/asset-pricing/crsp-sample/">earlier post</a>: I drop observations before 1962 as most papers in empirical asset pricing start in 1963 due to data availability; I drop stocks that are listed on exchanges other than NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ since Fama and French stress that they focus their seminal paper on these stocks.</p>

<h2>Prepare CRSP/Compustat Merged Data</h2>
<p>The next code chunk is explained in <a href="https://christophscheuch.github.io/post/asset-pricing/value/">this post</a> with two additions: I do not include firms until they have appeared in Compustat for two years, just as in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304405X93900235">Fama and French (1993)</a>. However, this extra filter only has a negligible impact on the overall results. Moreover, the construction of book equity is now based on the <a href="https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/variable_definitions.html">instructions provided on Kenneth French’s website</a> as opposed to the slightly simpler implementation in <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Empirical+Asset+Pricing%3A+The+Cross+Section+of+Stock+Returns-p-9781118095041">Bali, Engle and Murray (2016)</a>.</p>

<h2>Construct Stock Sample</h2>
<p>The stock sample used for the construction of the factors also builds on <a href="https://christophscheuch.github.io/post/asset-pricing/value/">this post</a>. Note that the relevant returns for the factor construction are the adjusted returns in the current month. In the end, only stocks that have valid book equity data from year <span class="math inline">\(y-1\)</span>, market equity data at the end of year <span class="math inline">\(y-1\)</span> and market capitalization in June of year <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> enter the factor construction procedure. Moreover, the market capitalization of June of year <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is used to construct value-weighted returns until May of year <span class="math inline">\(y+1\)</span>. I also restrict the sample to start in 1963, consistent with Fama and French.</p>

<h2>Size Sorts</h2>
<p>To construct the size portfolios, Fama and French independently sort all stocks into two portfolios according to the median of all NYSE stocks in the June of each year.

<p>To construct the <code>smb</code> and <code>hml</code> portfolios, I simply compute value-weighted returns for all combinations of value and size portfolios and then take the difference of the resulting portfolios as described by Fama and French.</p>

<p>The <code>mkt</code> factor exhibits a correlation of 99% which is a pretty good fit. The <code>smb</code> factor also shows a satisfying fit with 98%. The <code>hml</code> factor only has a correlation of 95% with its original counterpart which might be driven by different sample construction procedures that I am not yet aware of or some ex-post changes in the CRSP or Compustat data.</p>
<p>As a last step, I present the time series of cumulative returns over the full sample period.</p>
