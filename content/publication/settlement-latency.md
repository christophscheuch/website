abstract = "Distributed ledger technologies replace trusted clearing counterparties and security depositories with time-consuming consensus protocols to record the transfer of ownership. This settlement latency exposes cross-market arbitrageurs to price risk. We theoretically derive arbitrage bounds that increase with expected latency, latency uncertainty, volatility and risk aversion. Using Bitcoin orderbook and network data, we estimate arbitrage bounds of on average 121 basis points, explaining 91% of the observed cross-market price differences. Consistent with our theory, periods of high latency-implied price risk exhibit large price differences, while asset flows chase arbitrage opportunities. Blockchain-based settlement thus introduces a non-trivial friction that impedes arbitrage activity. <br/><br/>Presentations: QFFE 2018, $1^{st}$ International Conference on Data Science in Finance with R, $4^{th}$ Konstanz-Lancaster Workshop on Finance and Econometrics, Crypto Valley Blockchain Conference 2018, HFFE 2018, CFE 2018, CUNEF, University of Heidelberg, University of Vienna, University of Graz, $2^{nd}$ Toronto FinTech Conference, $4^{th}$ Vienna Workshop on High-Dimensional Time Series 2019, Conference on Market Microstructure and High Frequency Data 2019, FIRS Conference 2019, $12^{th}$ Annual SoFiE Conference, IMS at the National University of Singapore, $3^{rd}$ SAFE Microstructure Conference, EFA Annual Meeting 2019, Vienna Congress on Mathematical Finance, International Conference on Fintech & Financial Data Science 2019, $4^{th}$ International Workshop in Financial Econometrics, CFM-Imperial Workshop 2019, WFA 2020"
