abstract = "Crowdfunding allows entrepreneurs to sell claims on future products before investment takes place. Entrepreneurs thereby generate demand information and may condition the product development on it. I characterize the profit-maximizing crowdfunding mechanism in a setting where consumers have private information about their valuation of the potential future product. Two types of demand uncertainty matter for the optimal mechanism: the number of consumers who positively value the product and the magnitude of their valuation. A flexible price commitment that depends on the number of pledgers can implement first-best financing outcomes, but there exist parameter constellations under which entrepreneurs prefer fixed prices.
