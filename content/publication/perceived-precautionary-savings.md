abstract = "In a representative sample of new borrowers, access to lines of credit increases the spending of more liquid households permanently. Liquid consumers reduce their existing savings but do not tap into negative deposits, and hence do not raise debt. Through our FinTech bank setting, we elicit consumers' risk preferences, beliefs, perceptions, and other characteristics directly. No proxies for precautionary savings motives differ systematically across liquid and illiquid consumers. Liquid consumers appear to have higher subjective beliefs about precautionary savings, despite no different objective characteristics. Our results have implication for the transmission of policy to households through bank credit.<br/><br/>Presentations: Columbia New Technologies in Finance Conference 2019, Red Rock Finance Conference 2019, Summer Finance Conference at ISB 2019, $7^{th}$ ABFER Annual Conference,  LBS Summer Finance Symposium 2019, CFPB Conference 2019, AEA and AFA Annual Meeting 2020"
